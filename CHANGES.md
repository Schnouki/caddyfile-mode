# Caddyfile Mode 0.3

*Under development*

- Now available on MELPA!
- Add support for "simple" Caddyfiles, i.e. files that only contain a single
  list of labels. In that configuration, directives don't need to be nested in a
  top-level block, which makes editing a little bit easier.
- Emacs 25 is now required.
